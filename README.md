iOS Coding Challenge
Write an iPhone app that and lays out a series of images (urls provided) in a UICollectionView.
Requirements
1. Lay out the images in a two-column, variable-height pattern (similar to the grid on
pinterest.com).
2. The images should be downloaded from their urls lazily, as needed for display. Do not
pre-load them on launch or cache them in the application bundle.
3. The scrolling should be as smooth as possible.
Extra
1. Tap-to-zoom. Tapping on an image causes it to animate its size to fit the screen. Tap- ping again reverses the animation, returning the image to its original size and position in the grid.
2. Cycle through the images to fake the an infinite scroll.
